## Design for Flask Application

**Problem**: 
The web app should allow users to input a csv of expenses and it should Craft a Sankey diagram to visualize how various expenses are distributed across different categories based on input data. The Sankey diagram should accurately represent the flow of expenses from one category to another, capturing the interrelationships between expense categories. Ensure the diagram is clear, easy to interpret, and visually appealing.

**Proposed Solution**:

**1. HTML Files**:

- `index.html`: This will be the landing page of the application. It will contain a form that allows users to input a CSV file of their expenses and a "Submit" button.

- `sankey_diagram.html`: This page will display the Sankey diagram generated from the input data. It will include a container for the diagram as well as a section for displaying any errors or messages to the user.

**2. Routes**:

- `/`: This route will render the `index.html` page, allowing users to input their data.

- `/sankey_diagram`: This route will be triggered when the user submits the form on the `index.html` page. It will process the uploaded CSV file, calculate the necessary data, and render the `sankey_diagram.html` page with the generated diagram.

- `/error`: This route will be used to display any error messages to the user, such as an invalid CSV file format or missing data.

**3. Example Implementation**:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

# Initialize the Flask application
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define the routes
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/sankey_diagram', methods=['POST'])
def sankey_diagram():
    # Get the uploaded file from the request object
    csv_file = request.files['csv_file']

    # Validate if a file was uploaded
    if csv_file is None:
        # Return an error message if no file was uploaded
        return render_template('error.html', error_message="No file was uploaded.")

    # Read the CSV file and extract the data
    data = read_csv_file(csv_file)

    # Calculate the necessary data for the Sankey diagram
    sankey_data = calculate_sankey_data(data)

    # Render the `sankey_diagram.html` page with the generated data
    return render_template('sankey_diagram.html', sankey_data=sankey_data)

# Define helper functions for reading the CSV file and calculating the sankey data
def read_csv_file(csv_file):
    # Read the CSV file and extract the necessary data
    with open(csv_file, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        data = [row for row in reader]

    return data

def calculate_sankey_data(data):
    # Calculate the necessary data for the Sankey diagram
    # This can involve grouping the data by categories, calculating the flow between categories, etc.

    return sankey_data

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This Flask application design provides a clear structure for the web app to handle user input, process data, and display the Sankey diagram. It utilizes HTML pages and defines routes for different functionalities, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive application.
