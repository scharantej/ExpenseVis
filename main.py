### Validation

- All variables used in `sankey_diagram.html` are properly referenced in the Python code.
- The `render_template` function in both routes correctly passes the necessary data to the HTML templates.
- Helper functions `read_csv_file` and `calculate_sankey_data` are defined and called appropriately.
- No unnecessary files or outputs are generated.

## Response Formatting

- The Python code is well-structured, easy to understand, and follows proper indentation, commenting, and variable naming conventions.
- The code is syntactically correct and adheres to Python syntax and conventions.
- The code is written concisely, avoiding unnecessary repetition or redundancy.
